                <p>Pawsible aims to spread awareness of the issues related to shelters such as overcrowding by providing a safe and user-friendly platform where pet owners can list their pets for adoption and adopters can find the pet most suitable for them. A lot of animals are left in shelters because of owners being unable to look after them, which has led to many problems. Overcrowding has caused shelters to become incredibly stressful environments for the animals. Adopt don't shop!</p>
